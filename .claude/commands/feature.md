# Feature Planning

Create a new plan in specs/*.md to implement the `Feature` using the exact specified markdown `Plan Format`. Follow the `Instructions` to create the plan use the `Relevant Files` to focus on the right files.

## Instructions

- IMPORTANT: You're writing a plan to implement a net new feature based on the `Feature` that will add value to the application.
- IMPORTANT: The `Feature` describes the feature that will be implemented but remember we're not implementing a new feature, we're creating the plan that will be used to implement the feature based on the `Plan Format` below.
- IMPORTANT: Planning and implementation must strictly adhere to the coding guidelines in `/guidelines`.
- Create the plan file at `specs/issue-{issueNumber}-plan.md` where `{issueNumber}` is the issue number from the GitHub Issue (e.g., `specs/issue-36-plan.md` for issue #36).
- Use the `Plan Format` below to create the plan.
- Research the codebase to understand existing patterns, architecture, and conventions before planning the feature.
- IMPORTANT: Replace every <placeholder> in the `Plan Format` with the requested value. Add as much detail as needed to implement the feature successfully.
- Use your reasoning model: THINK HARD about the feature requirements, design, and implementation approach.
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase. Don't reinvent the wheel.
- Design for extensibility and maintainability.
- If you need a new library, use `uv add` and be sure to report it in the `Notes` section of the `Plan Format`.
- Respect requested files in the `Relevant Files` section.
- Start your research by reading the `README.md` file and the coding guidelines in `/guidelines`.

## Relevant Files

Focus on the following files:
- `README.md` - Contains the project overview and instructions.
- `guidelines/**` - Contains coding guidelines that must be followed.
- `src/app/**` - Contains Next.js App Router pages, layouts, and route handlers.
- `src/components/**` - Contains React components.
- `src/lib/**` - Contains utility functions and shared logic.
- `src/hooks/**` - Contains custom React hooks.
- `src/styles/**` - Contains global styles and CSS modules.
- `public/**` - Contains static assets.
- `adws/**` - Contains the AI Developer Workflow (ADW) scripts.

Ignore all other files in the codebase.

## Plan Format

```md
# Feature: <feature name>

## Feature Description
<describe the feature in detail, including its purpose and value to users>

## User Story
As a <type of user>
I want to <action/goal>
So that <benefit/value>

## Problem Statement
<clearly define the specific problem or opportunity this feature addresses>

## Solution Statement
<describe the proposed solution approach and how it solves the problem>

## Relevant Files
Use these files to implement the feature:

<find and list the files that are relevant to the feature describe why they are relevant in bullet points. If there are new files that need to be created to implement the feature, list them in an h3 'New Files' section.>

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Foundation
<describe the foundational work needed before implementing the main feature>

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
<describe the main implementation work for the feature>

### Phase 3: Integration
<describe how the feature will integrate with existing functionality>

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

<list step by step tasks as h3 headers plus bullet points. use as many h3 headers as needed to implement the feature. Order matters, start with the foundational shared changes required then move on to the specific implementation. Include creating tests throughout the implementation process.> 

<If the feature affects UI, include a task to create a E2E test file (like `.claude/commands/e2e-examples/example_test_sql_injection.md` and `.claude/commands/e2e-examples/example_test_basic_query.md`) as one of your early tasks. That e2e test should validate the feature works as expected, be specific with the steps to demonstrate the new functionality. We want the minimal set of steps to validate the feature works as expected and screen shots to prove it if possible.>

<Your last step should be running the `Validation Commands` to validate the feature works correctly with zero regressions.>

## Testing Strategy
### Unit Tests
<describe unit tests needed for the feature>

### Integration Tests
<describe integration tests needed for the feature>

### Edge Cases
<list edge cases that need to be tested>

## Acceptance Criteria
<list specific, measurable criteria that must be met for the feature to be considered complete>

## Validation Commands
Execute every command to validate the feature works correctly with zero regressions.

<list commands you'll use to validate with 100% confidence the feature is implemented correctly with zero regressions. every command must execute without errors so be specific about what you want to run to validate the feature works as expected. Include commands to test the feature end-to-end.>

<If you created an E2E test, include the following validation step: `Read .claude/commands/test_e2e.md`, then read and execute your new E2E `e2e-tests/test_<descriptive_name>.md` test file to validate this functionality works.>

- `npm run lint` - Run linter to check for code quality issues
- `npm run build` - Build the application to verify no build errors
- `npm test` - Run tests to validate the feature works with zero regressions

## Notes
<optionally list any additional notes, future considerations, or context that are relevant to the feature that will be helpful to the developer>
```

## Feature
$ARGUMENTS

## Report
- Summarize the work you've just done in a concise bullet point list.
- Include the full path to the plan file you created (e.g., `specs/issue-456-adw-xyz789-sdlc_planner-add-auth-system.md`)
