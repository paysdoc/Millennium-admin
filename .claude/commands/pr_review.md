# PR-review Planning

Create a new plan at `specs/issue-{issueNumber}-plan.md` (where `{issueNumber}` is the issue number) to resolve the `PR-Review` using the exact specified markdown `Plan Format`. Follow the `Instructions` to create the plan use the `Relevant Files` to focus on the right files. Follow the `Report` section to properly report the results of your work.

## Instructions

- IMPORTANT: You're writing a plan to resolve a review based on the `PR-Review` that will add value to the application.
- IMPORTANT: The `PR-Review` describes the review that will be resolved but remember we're not resolving the review, we're creating the plan that will be used to resolve the review based on the `Plan Format` below.
- IMPORTANT: Planning and implementation must strictly adhere to the coding guidelines in `/guidelines`.
- You're writing a plan to resolve a PR review, it should be simple but we need to be thorough and precise so we don't miss anything or waste time with any second round of changes.
- Analyze each review comment carefully and understand what changes are required to resolve the review.
- Create a revision plan at `specs/issue-{issueNumber}-plan.md` (where `{issueNumber}` is the issue number from the GitHub Issue) that addresses ALL review comments in the `PR-Review`.
- Use the plan format below to create the plan.
- Research the codebase and put together a plan to accomplish the review.
- IMPORTANT: Replace every <placeholder> in the `Plan Format` with the requested value. Add as much detail as needed to accomplish the review.
- Consider the plan and the steps to accomplish the review.
- Respect requested files in the `Relevant Files` section.
- Start your research by reading the `README.md` file and the coding guidelines in `/guidelines`.
- `adws/*.tsx` contain node tsx single file typescript scripts. So if you want to run them use `npx tsx <script_name>`.
- When you finish creating the plan for the review, follow the `Report` section to properly report the results of your work.

## Relevant Files

Focus on the following files:
- `README.md` - Contains the project overview and instructions.
- `guidelines/**` - Contains coding guidelines that must be followed.
- `src/app/**` - Contains Next.js App Router pages, layouts, and route handlers.
- `src/components/**` - Contains React components.
- `src/lib/**` - Contains utility functions and shared logic.
- `src/hooks/**` - Contains custom React hooks.
- `src/styles/**` - Contains global styles and CSS modules.
- `public/**` - Contains static assets.
- `adws/**` - Contains the AI Developer Workflow (ADW) scripts.

Ignore all other files in the codebase.

## Plan Format

```md
# PR-Review: <review name>

## PR-Review Description
<describe the review in detail>

## Summary of Original Implementation Plan
<retrieve existingPlanContent from the original implementation plan base on the issue number. Search the agent state first, then search recent github commits in the current branch for new *.md files and evaluate if that was the plan. If it does not exit, write "N/A", otherwise write a summary of the original implementation plan.>

## Relevant Files
Use these files to resolve the review:

<find and list the files that are relevant to the review describe why they are relevant in bullet points. If there are new files that need to be created to accomplish the review, list them in an h3 'New Files' section.>

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

<list step by step tasks as h3 headers plus bullet points. use as many h3 headers as needed to accomplish the review. Order matters, start with the foundational shared changes required to fix the review then move on to the specific changes required to fix the review. Your last step should be running the `Validation Commands` to validate the review is complete with zero regressions.>

## Validation Commands
Execute every command to validate the review is complete with zero regressions.

<list commands you'll use to validate with 100% confidence the review is complete with zero regressions. every command must execute without errors so be specific about what you want to run to validate the review is complete with zero regressions. Don't validate with curl commands.>
- `npm run lint` - Run linter to check for code quality issues
- `npm run build` - Build the application to verify no build errors
- `npm test` - Run tests to validate the review is complete with zero regressions

## Notes
<optionally list any additional notes or context that are relevant to the review that will be helpful to the developer>
```
