# Coding Guidelines

## Core Principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness** — Code should be easy to read and understand. Favor explicit over implicit. Use meaningful variable names and comments to explain non-obvious logic.
2. **Modularity** — Each unit (file, function, component) has a single responsibility. Keep files under 300 lines.
3. **Immutability** — Treat data as immutable. Create new values instead of mutating existing ones.
4. **Type safety** — Leverage the type system to catch errors at compile time, not runtime.
5. **Purity** — Prefer pure functions. Isolate side effects at the boundaries.
6. **Security by default** — Validate inputs, sanitize outputs, follow OWASP practices.

## General Practices

- **Error handling** — Use try-catch at system boundaries. Provide meaningful error messages.
- **Testing** — Write unit tests for all components. Cover edge cases. Use mocking to isolate tests.
- **Performance** — Optimize critical paths (rendering, data processing). Profile before optimizing.
- **Security** — Validate inputs, use secure authentication, encrypt sensitive data. Regularly review code for vulnerabilities.

## TypeScript Practices

- **Strict mode** — Enable all strict compiler options (`noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`, `strictFunctionTypes`).
- **Avoid `any`** — Use specific types, generics, or `unknown`. Let strict mode enforce this.
- **Interfaces and types** — Define explicit types for data structures. Use interfaces for object shapes, type aliases for unions and intersections.
- **Type narrowing** — Use type guards and optional chaining over the `!` non-null assertion operator.
- **Utility types** — Leverage built-in utility types (`Readonly`, `Partial`, `Record`, `Pick`, `Omit`) to express intent clearly.
- **Enums** — Use enums for named constant sets. Avoid magic numbers and strings.
- **Generics** — Use generics for reusable components and functions that work across types.

## Functional Programming Practices

- **Declarative over imperative** — Use map, filter, reduce, and flatMap over for/while loops.
- **Composition** — Build complex operations by composing small, focused functions. Avoid deep nesting.
- **Isolate side effects** — Keep side effects (API calls, logging, DOM access) at the edges. Core logic should be pure: same input, same output, no external state.

## React & Next.js Practices

- **Component structure** — Prefer functional components. Keep components focused on a single UI concern.
- **Server vs. Client components** — Default to Server Components. Only add `"use client"` when you need interactivity, hooks, or browser APIs.
- **Hooks** — Extract reusable logic into custom hooks. Avoid deeply nested hook dependencies.
- **State management** — Keep state as local as possible. Lift state only when sibling components need it.
- **Data fetching** — Fetch data in Server Components where possible. Use Supabase client utilities from `src/lib/supabase.ts`.
- **Naming conventions** — PascalCase for components and their files (`UserProfile.tsx`). camelCase for utilities, hooks, and non-component files (`useAuth.ts`, `formatDate.ts`). kebab-case for directories (`user-profile/`).

## Process & Tooling

- **Version control** — Commit frequently with clear messages.
- **Continuous integration** — Automate testing and quality checks (e.g., GitHub Actions).
- **Formatting** — Use Prettier and ESLint for consistent style.
- **Code hygiene** — Remove unused variables, functions, and imports.
- **Documentation** — Document public APIs and non-obvious logic with JSDoc. Keep the README and setup instructions current.
